# Lunar OS for 64bit and UEFI
Lunar OS is a hobby OS I'm writing but I wanted it to work on all modern hardware if possible

Lunar written with the Limine bootloader by [@mintsuki](https://github.com/mintsuki) https://github.com/limine-bootloader/

Lunar OS is still growing and I aim to have a working and fleshed out terminal soon.
